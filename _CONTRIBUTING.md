# Contributing

1) Use 'git pull upstream development' before pushing your work

2) Prefix each commit like so:
  - [feat] Added a new feature
  - [fix] Fixed inconsistent tests (Fixes #0)
  - [refactor] ...
  - [cleanup] ...
  - [test] ...
  - [doc] ...
  - [layout] ...
  - [chore] ...

3) Add comments as much as possible.
  
  Commenting a lot will not only help anyone that attempts to work off your code, but it will help you think through   what you've coded. When you alter code that is already commented, please alter the comment when appropriate.
